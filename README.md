## 🧭 Overview
**Optimal Ship Routing** is an **AI-powered maritime navigation system** designed to determine the safest, most fuel-efficient, and weather-aware ship routes across the **Indian Ocean region**.  
Traditional GPS-based routes often ignore real-time weather, sea currents, and terrain, resulting in longer journeys, higher fuel costs, and safety risks.  

Our solution integrates **Machine Learning**, **real-time weather data**, and **interactive geospatial visualization** to compute and display **three intelligent route paths**:
- 🔵 **Blue:** Straight GPS route (shortest path, often unrealistic)
- 🟢 **Green:** AI-optimized route (balances weather safety, fuel efficiency, and distance)

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🧠 **ML-Powered Route Optimization** — Calculates the best possible sea route using ML predictions based on live oceanic and meteorological data.  
- 🌦️ **Weather Visualization** — Integrates OpenWeatherMap layers to display wind and cloud coverage.  
- 🗺️ **Interactive Map Interface** — Built using React-Leaflet for real-time, multi-route visualization.  
- ⚡ **Dynamic Route Updates** — Monitors changing conditions and updates paths automatically.  
- 📊 **System Monitoring Panel** — Displays model health, API status, and live route metrics.  
- 🔍 **Prediction Engine** — Provides risk and efficiency forecasts for selected route points.
